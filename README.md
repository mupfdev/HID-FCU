## About

HID-FCU is an autopilot control unit for use with Microsoft Flight
Simulator based on the [Bendix/King KAP
140](https://www.bendixking.com/content/dam/bendixking/en/documents/document-lists/downloads-and-manuals/006-18034-0000-KAP-140-Pilots-Guide.pdf)
autopilot system used in many aircraft such as the Pilatus PC-6
Turbo-Porter.

Since the unit, as already implied by the title, is detected as a Human
Interface Device (HID), it can be used both on the PC and on the Xbox.

The hardware is based on an STM32F103 microcontroller and the case of a
defective laboratory power supply.
